ToneGrid â€“ A Dynamic JavaScript Drum Kit
ToneGrid is an interactive, keyboard-powered drum kit built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. 
Created as part of the Wes Bos 30-Day JavaScript Challenge, 
this project transforms your keyboard into a fully functional beat-making tool, 
allowing users to trigger drum sounds with key presses in real time.

ðŸ”¹ How It Works
Each key on the virtual drum pad corresponds to a different percussion sound. 
Pressing a key plays its assigned sound while adding a visual effect, creating an engaging, tactile experience. 
The drum kit responds instantly, ensuring smooth and rhythmic beat-making.
